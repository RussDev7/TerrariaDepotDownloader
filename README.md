**TerrariaDepotDownloader** - Downgrade your game to any of the past game versions where the steam manifest IDs are known.

## How It Works / Legal
Steam allows the downloading of previous game versions through the use of depots. Depots are a collection of files pertaining to a group; for steam, the game Terraria. When a game gets updated, steam archives each patch as something called a manifest ID. Using steam [console](steam//nav/console) and the correct manifest ID, you can downgrade/download any game version that you own on your account. Using an open source utility called [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader), you can download depots with a lot more flexibility.

Included in this application's directory is a file named `ManifestVersions.cfg`. This file is in charge of all the game versions and their data which is loaded into the program. This can be updated to include future versions or previously unknown earlier versions of the game without the need to download a new tool version.

**Note to Terraria's team:** I have created this courtesyware in hopes to diminish pirating and bring easability to downgrading. If their is any issues with this tool please do not hessitate to contact me.

Why this is happening?
<p></p>

Built into Windows 10, is something called Windows Defender SmartScreen. Each time an application is ran Windows 10, SmartScreen will check if it is a “good” application against their catalog of applications. It’s a good security measure and is particular helpful at stopping malware spreading through email attachments – where some users do not understand the difference between a legitimate document and an application. Sometimes SmartScreen will prevent applications you know are not bad – for example, it’s a CMD or VBS script you wrote, or a program from a trusted source.

Why this is happening?

This issue is caused from one of the hardcoded checks Terraria does to make sure you own the game. You need to have the game inside your steamapps directory to prevent this error.

  <details><summary>Older versions crash when selecting single player.</summary><p></p>
    
`Fix #1:`\
To fix this its super simple. You need to move your Terraria folder (\Documents\My Games\Terraria) to a different location for safe keeping. Then try and reload the game back up. You will have to create a new player and a new world.

Why this is happening?

The older versions can crash and or now show all the UI options when attempting to read newer player and world files.
  </details>
  <details><summary>Steam won't let me play older versions until it "Updates".</summary><p></p>
    
`Fix #1:`\
Within your steam client, go to `Library > Terraria > Properties > Updates` and change `Automatic Updates` to Only `update this game when I launch it` and turn `Background Downloads` to `Never allow background downloads`.

`Fix #2:`\
Launching steam in offline mode it will prevent the searching of a new update. You can do this within your steam client by navigating to Steam > Go offline or by closing steam, disconnecting from the internet, and re-launching steam.

Why this is happening?

For some people, steam will try to keep Terraria up to date automatically. This can very on your settings within steam.
